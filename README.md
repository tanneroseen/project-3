# project-3
test.py is me trying to figure out how streamlit works, which is what we'll use to display the graphs on a webpage,
I don't know if you guys will be able to get it running or not cause I had to make an account but you can give it a try.
project_3.py is our graphs from the first project in matplotlib.pyplot format.
We need all 3 graphs made with plotly and there's some simple examples in the test file.
Reid's should be pretty easy.
Gavin's I haven't looked at yet but might be tricky to get exact.
I've figured mine out for everything except colour bar.
